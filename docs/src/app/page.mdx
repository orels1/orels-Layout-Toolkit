## Installation {{ date: '2030-01-01T00:00Z', label: 'Get Started' }}

- Add to the VRChat Creator Companion using this link: [Add to the VCC](vcc://vpm/addRepo?url=https://orels1.github.io/orels-Layout-Toolkit/index.json)
- Make sure the "orels-Layout-Toolkit" Repository is added and selected in the Settings screen
- Open your World project and add the "ORL Layout Toolkit" Package

### Single-file Installation

A single-file version of the package is available for download [here](https://github.com/orels1/orels-Layout-Toolkit/releases).
    - You can drop `ORLLayoutToolkit.cs` file into any Editor folder in your project and it should work as expected
    - The only limitation of this approach is that you will not get the utility classes stylesheet included, so things like `Label().Class("pr-2")` will need to be written like `Label().Padding(0, 4, 0, 0)`
    - If you're looking to actively edit the source code - it is recommended to use single-file installations, that will allow you to extend all the included partial classes easily

## Setup

- Inherit your EditorWindows from `ORL.Layout.EnhancedEditorWindow` and your custom editors from `ORL.Layout.EnhancedEditor` 
- Override the `protected VisualElement Render()` method
- See examples below

### Simple Editor Window

```cs
using ORL.Layout;
using ORL.Layout.Extensions;
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UIElements;

namespace Examples
{
    public class SimpleEditorWindow : EnhancedEditorWindow
    {
        [MenuItem("Tools/Simple Editor Window")]
        public static void ShowWindow()
        {
            var window = GetWindow<SimpleEditorWindow>();
            window.titleContent = new GUIContent("Simple Editor Window");
            window.Show();
        }

        private readonly ReactiveProperty<int> _counter = new(0);

        protected override VisualElement Render()
        {
            return VStack(
                Label("Sophisticated Couter").Bold().Margin(0, 0, 4),
                HStack(
                    Label().BoundPropText(_counter, c => $"Counter: {c}"),
                    Button(() => _counter.Set(_counter + 1)).Text("Increment")
                ).AlignItems(Align.Center).JustifyContent(Justify.SpaceBetween)
            ).Padding(4);
        }
    }
}
```

Let's go over the code a little bit

- We defined a `Render()` method that returns a `VisualElement` tree
- We started with a VStack (vertical stack) which is usually a good starting point for any layout as it simply aligns any children vertically
- We added a `Label` element which was then bound to a `ReactiveProperty`
  - A `ReactiveProperty` is a simple container for any value, which can then be observed via `OnChange` and updated with `Set` methods
  - In case of a `Label` if we had a `string` property - we could've simply bound it to the `Label` with `BoundPropText(_myStringProp)` method, as it is directly compatible with `string` type
  - Since we're using `ReactiveProperty<int>` in this case - you need to supply a compute method, in this case `c => $"Counter: {c}"` which will be called every time the value changes
- We then created a button that calls `Set` method on the `ReactiveProperty` to increment the counter, which automatically updates the `Label` text
- The rest of the calls like `Bold()`, `Margin()`, `Padding()` are all utility layout methods to make the inspector looks nicer

The final result looks something like this

![Simple Editor Window](@/images/image-0.png "Simple Editor Window")

### Simple Custom Inspector

Let's make a simple MonoBehaviour to hold some example data first

```cs
using UnityEngine;

namespace Examples
{
    public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public float health = 100;
        public float damage = 10;
        public Transform spawnPoint;
        public Transform target;
    }
}
```

This should be a good starting point.

By default, such a behaviour will have an inspector like this

![Default Inspector](@/images/image-1.png "Default Inspector")

Which can be good enough for a lot of things, but what if you wanted some quick buttons to reset the health, or to respawn the enemy?

Let's write an inspector for it to enhance the base unity editing functionality

```cs
using ORL.Layout;
using ORL.Layout.Extensions;
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine.UIElements;

namespace Examples
{
    [CustomEditor(typeof(Enemy))]
    public class EnemyEditor : EnhancedEditor
    {
        protected override VisualElement Render()
        {
            return VStack(
                HStack(
                    PropertyField(serializedObject.FindProperty("health")).Flex(1),
                    Button(() =>
                    {
                        serializedObject.FindProperty("health").floatValue = 100;
                        serializedObject.ApplyModifiedProperties();
                    }).Text("Reset")
                ).JustifyContent(Justify.SpaceBetween),
                PropertyField(serializedObject.FindProperty("damage")),
                Label("Positions").Bold().Margin(10, 0, 0, 3),
                PropertyField(serializedObject.FindProperty("spawnPoint")),
                PropertyField(serializedObject.FindProperty("target")),
                Foldout().Text("Utilities").Class("unity-foldout").ViewDataKey("utilities-foldout").Margin(0, -4, 0, -14)
                    .Children(
                        HStack(
                            Button(() =>
                            {
                                var enemy = (Enemy)target;
                                enemy.health = 100;
                                enemy.transform.position = enemy.spawnPoint.position;
                            }).Text("Respawn"),
                            Button(() =>
                            {
                                var enemy = (Enemy)target;
                                enemy.health = 0;
                            }).Text("Kill")
                        )
                    )
            );
        }
    }
}
```

Let's walk through the new things in this example

- Since this is a custom inspector - it is common to rely on `serializedObject` to access the properties of the target object, so we use `PropetyField` for a lot of regular fields as there is no reason to reinvent the wheel
- To adjust the `health` property field via a "Reset" button we simply referenced it through the serialized object and updated all the properties in-place.
  - You can also use `ReactiveProperty<float>` in a case like this, and then bind it to a `serializedProperty` so it would automatically get updated when you call `Set`. Here's how that would look

```cs
private readonly ReactiveProperty<float> _health = new(100);

protected override VisualElement Render()
{
    var healhProp = serializedObject.FindProperty("health");
    _health.BindToProperty(healhProp).Set(healhProp.floatValue);
    return VStack(
        PropertyField(healhProp),
        Button(() => _health.Set(100)).Text("Reset")
    );
}
```

- There is no functional difference between the two approaches, so feel free to use whichever feels the most intuitive to you

> `BindToProperty` does its best to map the type you used in the `ReactiveProperty` to the type of the `serializedProperty` and will show a warning message if they are incompatible

- We also leveraged `Foldout` to create a collapsible section for the utility buttons
  - The `ViewDataKey` is used to persist the state of the foldout between the inspector reloads
- Lastly, we interacted directly with the current target object without persisting the changes to the serialized object, which is a common pattern when you want to perform some quick actions during play mode

The final inspector ends up looking like this

## Changelog {{ label: 'Changelog' }}

Below are the changelogs for all of the releases of orels Layout Toolkit

---

## v1.0.0 Release {{ date: '2024-03-18T21:45:00+04:00' }}

First release of orels Layout Toolkit!

This includes the main package with an ability to create a wide range of custom editor windows and inspectors.

### <BoltIcon /> New Features

- `HStack` element, stacks child elements horizontally
- `VStack` element, stacks child elements vertically
- `ReactiveProperty<T>` class, a reactive value container which UI elements can be bound to. This allows for auto-updating UI elements when the value changes
    - E.g. `Label().BindToProp(someStringProp)` will automatically update the label when `someStringProp.Set()` is called
- `ForEach` element, renders a list of elements based on the provided `IEnumerable<T>` and a template
    - Can be bound to a `ReactiveProperty<T>` of the same type to auto-render on change.
