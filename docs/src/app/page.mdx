## Installation {{ date: '2030-01-01T00:00Z', label: 'Get Started' }}

- Add to the VRChat Creator Companion using this link: [Add to the VCC](vcc://vpm/addRepo?url=https://orels1.github.io/orels-Layout-Toolkit/index.json)
- Make sure the "orels-Layout-Toolkit" Repository is added and selected in the Settings screen
- Open your World project and add the "ORL Layout Toolkit" Package

### Single-file Installation

A single-file version of the package is available for download [here](https://github.com/orels1/orels-Layout-Toolkit/releases).
    - You can drop `ORLLayoutToolkit.cs` file into any Editor folder in your project and it should work as expected
    - The only limitation of this approach is that you will not get the utility classes stylesheet included, so things like `Label().Class("pr-2")` will need to be written like `Label().Padding(0, 4, 0, 0)`
    - If you're looking to actively edit the source code - it is recommended to use single-file installations, that will allow you to extend all the included partial classes easily

## Setup

- Inherit your EditorWindows from `ORL.Layout.EnhancedEditorWindow` and your custom editors from `ORL.Layoot.EnhancedEditor` 
- Override the `protected VisualElement Render()` method
- See examples below

### <BoltIcon /> New Features

- `HStack` element, stacks child elements horizontally
- `VStack` element, stacks child elements vertically
- `ReactiveProperty<T>` class, a reactive value container which UI elements can be bound to. This allows for auto-updating UI elements when the value changes
    - E.g. `Label().BindToProp(someStringProp)` will automatically update the label when `someStringProp.Set()` is called
- `ForEach` element, renders a list of elements based on the provided `IEnumerable<T>` and a template
    - Can be bound to a `ReactiveProperty<T>` of the same type to auto-render on change.
